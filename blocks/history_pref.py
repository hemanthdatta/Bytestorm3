    Reads the user activity log and uses a two-step process with the Gemini model

    Step 1: Analyze logs to identify preferences and suggest a query (internal thought process).
    Step 2: Refine the output of Step 1 into a single, concise search query.

      base_product_name: The type of product (e.g., "smartphone", "headphones").

    You are a personal shopping assistant. Below is the user’s raw activity log:
    {logs_text}

    Based on this history, thoroughly analyze the user's likely preferences for a new '{base_product_name}'.
    Consider their preferred brands, favored colors, typical price ranges, ratings, and any other repeated patterns.
    Describe these preferences in a few sentences and explicitly suggest what a good search query might look like based on your analysis. This is an intermediate step; the final query will be extracted later.
    Example of your output for this step:
    "The user seems to prefer Apple products, particularly in Space Gray or Silver. They have purchased items around $1000. For a new smartphone, a good query might be 'Apple smartphone Space Gray under $1200'."

    prompt2 = f"""
    You are a query refinement assistant. Based on the following analysis of user preferences for a '{base_product_name}':

    Analysis Provided:
    {detailed_analysis}

    Your task is to extract or formulate ONLY ONE concise search query from the Analysis Provided.
    This query should include the product type ('{base_product_name}') and the most salient preferences (e.g., brand, color, price) identified in the analysis.

    ### Example of how to process Analysis to Output:
    Analysis Provided: The user seems to prefer Philips brand for irons, often looks at blue items, and has searched for items under 3000 rs. A good query might be "blue Philips iron box under 3000 rs".
    Product: 'iron box'
    Output: "blue Philips iron box under 3000 rs"

    Analysis Provided: User likes Sony headphones, often black, and has bought items around $300-$400. A good query could be "black Sony headphones around $350".
    Product: 'headphones'
    Output: "black Sony headphones around $350"

    IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR FINAL OUTPUT:
    1. Your response MUST be ONLY the concise search query itself.
    2. DO NOT include any introductory phrases (like "Here is the query:", "The query is:", "Based on the analysis, the query is:").
    3. DO NOT include any explanations, apologies, or any text whatsoever other than the generated search query.
    4. If the determined query is "Silver smartphone under $500", your output must be exactly: Silver smartphone under $500
    Ensure your output is ONLY the query string.
