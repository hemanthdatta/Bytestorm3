# Sample Images for Checkout Automation

Place your sample product images in this directory. These will be used by the checkout automation agent when testing.

## Requirements

- Images should be in JPG, PNG, or WebP format
- Ensure at least one image named `sample_product.jpg` is present (this is used by default)
- For best results, use images that clearly show a product against a clean background

## Example

The default image path used by the automation agent is:

```
./samples/sample_product.jpg
```

You can customize this path when initializing the agent.
